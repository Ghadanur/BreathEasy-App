// This file is no longer needed as its functionality for fetching air quality data
// has been replaced by the src/hooks/useAirQualityReadings.ts hook.
// The AI flow for personalized tips (src/ai/flows/personalized-air-quality-tips.ts)
// and the PersonalizedTips.tsx component do not depend on this service directly
// for their core logic but rather on the data structure (AirQualityReading) and the AI flow function.
// This file can be safely removed from the project.
